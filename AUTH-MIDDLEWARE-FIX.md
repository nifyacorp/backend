# Authentication Middleware Fix

## Issue

The latest test results revealed an authentication middleware error when trying to access secured endpoints:

```
Cannot set property context of #<Request> which has only a getter
```

This error occurs because we were trying to modify a read-only property (`context`) on the Express request object. In Express.js, some properties are defined with getters but no setters, making them read-only.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Modified Auth Middleware

Changed `auth.middleware.js` to use `userContext` instead of `context`:

```javascript
// Before (causing error):
request.context = request.context || {};
request.context.token = { sub: decoded.sub, email: decoded.email, name: decoded.name };

// After (fixed):
request.userContext = {
  token: {
    sub: decoded.sub,
    email: decoded.email,
    name: decoded.name
  }
};
```

This avoids the conflict with the read-only `context` property.

### 2. Updated Route Handlers

Updated all references to `request.context` in route handlers to use `request.userContext` instead:

```javascript
// Before:
const context = {
  requestId: request.id,
  path: request.url,
  method: request.method,
  token: request.context?.token || request.user?.token || {
    sub: request.user?.id,
    email: request.user?.email,
    name: request.user?.name
  }
};

// After:
const context = {
  requestId: request.id,
  path: request.url,
  method: request.method,
  token: request.userContext?.token || request.user?.token || {
    sub: request.user?.id,
    email: request.user?.email,
    name: request.user?.name
  }
};
```

### 3. Added Diagnostic Endpoints

Added missing diagnostic endpoints to help with testing:

1. `/api/diagnostics/db-status` - Checks database connection status and performance
2. `/api/diagnostics/db-tables` - Returns list of tables in the database

## Impact

These changes address the authentication middleware issue that was blocking access to secure endpoints. With this fix, the following features should now work correctly:

- Subscription creation and management
- Notification retrieval
- User profile functions
- Diagnostic endpoints requiring authentication

The fix is non-intrusive and maintains the same functionality but uses a property name that won't conflict with Express internals.

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Run the backend server with the latest changes
2. Execute the comprehensive test suite again
3. Verify that secured endpoints no longer return the middleware error
4. Check that user authentication context is properly passed to services

This should allow the previous fixes for foreign key constraints and notification format to be properly tested and verified.

## Next Steps

1. Run a complete test of the backend API 
2. Verify that subscription creation now works with proper user creation
3. Check that notification API endpoints return correctly formatted responses
