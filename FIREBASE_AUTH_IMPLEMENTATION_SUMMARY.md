# Firebase Authentication Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Firebase Authentication in the backend service.

## 1. Implementation Steps Completed

1. **Firebase Admin SDK Installation**
   - Added `firebase-admin` package to the project
   - Updated `package.json` to document the dependency

2. **Firebase Admin SDK Initialization**
   - Created `src/infrastructure/firebase/admin.js` to initialize the Firebase Admin SDK
   - Setup Firebase project ID from environment variables

3. **Firebase Authentication Middleware**
   - Created `src/interfaces/http/middleware/firebase-auth.middleware.js` with:
     - `firebaseAuthenticate` function for Fastify hooks
     - `firebaseAuthMiddleware` function for Express-style middleware
   - Implemented token verification with Firebase Admin SDK
   - Maintained user synchronization with database

4. **Auth Service Updates**
   - Modified `src/core/auth/auth.service.js` to use Firebase for token verification
   - Kept legacy JWT verification for backward compatibility during transition
   - Added Firebase user lookup functionality

5. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Created migration to add `firebase_uid` column to users table
   - Added database index for `firebase_uid` column
   - Setup migration to run during application startup

6. **Server Integration**
   - Updated `src/index.js` to initialize Firebase Admin SDK
   - Replaced the old authentication middleware with Firebase authentication

7. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added Firebase configuration variables to `.env.example`
   - Documented required environment variables

## 2. How It Works

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Frontend authenticates users with Firebase Authentication
   - Frontend includes Firebase ID token in Authorization header for API requests
   - Backend verifies the token using Firebase Admin SDK
   - User information is synchronized with the database

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Legacy JWT verification is still available during the transition
   - New code paths use Firebase authentication
   - The system will attempt Firebase verification first, then fall back to JWT if needed

3. **User Synchronization**
   - When users authenticate with Firebase, their information is synchronized with the database
   - Existing users are updated with their Firebase UID
   - New users are created with their Firebase information

## 3. Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test authentication flow with Firebase tokens
   - Verify user synchronization with database
   - Test token expiration and error handling

2. **Migration**
   - Migrate existing users to Firebase Authentication
   - Update frontend to use Firebase Authentication exclusively
   - Remove legacy JWT verification once migration is complete

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor authentication errors and failures
   - Ensure proper logging of authentication events
   - Track user synchronization issues

## 4. Configuration

The following environment variables are required for Firebase Authentication:

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```
