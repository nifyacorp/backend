# Migration System Changes

## Summary

We've implemented a production-safe migration system that is now the default deployment method. This ensures database migrations are applied consistently without data loss.

## Key Changes

1. **Production-Safe Migrations**
   - Created `safe-migrations.js` to handle migrations safely
   - New system preserves existing data while fixing migration issues
   - Handles edge cases like non-existent schema_version table

2. **Schema Version Tracking**
   - Added dedicated migration to create schema_version table
   - Each migration is now tracked to prevent re-application
   - Clear tracking of which migrations have been applied

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Better error messages with line numbers for SQL problems
   - Transaction support to prevent partial migrations
   - Error location information for easier debugging

4. **Simplified Deployment**
   - Created `deploy-with-safe-migrations.sh` script
   - Automatically handles common migration issues
   - Creates database backups before deployment

5. **Fixed JSON Syntax**
   - Updated problematic migrations with correct JSON syntax
   - Fixed issue with the `boe` token that was causing deployments to fail

## How It Works

The new migration system:

1. First checks if the `schema_version` table exists, creating it if needed
2. Applies special migrations (like schema creation) outside of transactions
3. Applies regular migrations inside transactions for safety
4. Records each applied migration in the schema_version table
5. Provides detailed logging and error reporting

## Benefits

- **No Data Loss**: Preserves existing database data
- **More Reliable**: Better error handling and recovery
- **Easier to Debug**: Clear error messages with line numbers
- **Better Tracking**: Proper migration version history
- **Safer Deployments**: Automatic backups and checks

## How to Use

### For Normal Deployments

Simply use the new deployment script:

```bash
./deploy-with-safe-migrations.sh
```

### For Testing Migrations Locally

Use the migration validation script:

```bash
node test-migrations.js
```

### For Advanced Use Cases

See the `HOW-TO-DEPLOY-MIGRATIONS.md` file for detailed options and troubleshooting.

## Long-term Improvements

1. **Schema Validation**: Add validation between code and database schema
2. **Migration Generation**: Tools to generate migrations from schema changes
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Track dependencies between migrations
4. **Rollback Support**: Ability to roll back problematic migrations
5. **Testing Framework**: Automated tests for migrations before deployment
