## Implementation Details

### Core Architecture
- Created domain models with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented repository interfaces with proper typing
- Created service interfaces that define business operations
- Implemented error handling with standardized AppError class

### Subscription Domain
- Implemented SubscriptionEntity with proper value objects
- Created SubscriptionRepository interface with all needed operations
- Implemented SubscriptionService with business logic
- Added repository implementation for Supabase

### Notification Domain
- Implemented NotificationEntity with proper status tracking
- Created NotificationRepository interface with comprehensive operations
- Implemented NotificationService with business logic including statistics
- Added repository implementation for Supabase
- Implemented mark as read/unread functionality
- Added bulk operations support

### API Layer
- Created consistent API response format
- Implemented Fastify plugins for auth, database, and error handling
- Added subscription and notification controllers with all operations
- Implemented routes with proper validation
- Added pagination, filtering, and sorting support

### Database Access
- Implemented database client with RLS support
- Added transaction support
- Created mappings between domain entities and database records

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Template domain:
   - Create TemplateEntity
   - Implement TemplateRepository interface
   - Create TemplateService
   - Add template controller and routes

2. Implement the User domain:
   - Create UserEntity
   - Implement UserRepository interface
   - Create UserService
   - Add user controller and routes

3. Add unit and integration tests for all components

4. Update database schema with proper migrations

5. Enhance documentation with OpenAPI specs

6. Implement monitoring and metrics collection

## Open Issues

- Need to integrate with actual Auth Service for token validation
- Need to implement PubSub integration for event publishing
- Database schema needs to be finalized and validated
- Implement missing RLS policies
