# Subscription API Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to address issues with the subscription API.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Empty Subscription Objects Returned After Creation

**Problem:**
- The subscription creation endpoint was returning empty objects without IDs
- This prevented further testing of subscription functionality

**Solution:**
- Fixed the subscription controller to properly handle database results
- Updated the response formatting to ensure complete subscription objects
- Added special handling for prompts field to support both array and string formats

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/interfaces/http/routes/subscription/crud.routes.js`
- `/src/core/subscription/services/subscription.service.js`

**Key Changes:**
- Updated the subscription creation controller to extract data from the database result
- Added proper formatting of subscription objects in the controller response
- Modified schema validation to allow both array and string formats for prompts

### 2. Subscription Types Endpoint Returning 500 Errors

**Problem:**
- The `/api/v1/subscriptions/types` endpoint was failing with 500 errors
- This prevented selection of subscription types in the frontend

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the subscription types service with better error handling
- Added table existence check and automatic creation of missing tables
- Added support for display_name column which might be missing

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/core/subscription/services/type.service.js`
- Created a new migration script

**Key Changes:**
- Added _ensureTypesTableExists method to check/create table if needed
- Enhanced getSubscriptionTypes method to handle missing tables or columns
- Added display_name column support for better frontend compatibility
- Created migration script to ensure database schema compatibility

### 3. Database Migration

Created a new migration script to ensure database compatibility:
- `/supabase/migrations/20250404000000_fix_subscription_api.sql`

The migration script:
- Adds display_name column to subscription_types if it doesn't exist
- Creates subscription_types table if it doesn't exist
- Inserts default subscription types (BOE, DOGA, Real Estate) if table is empty

### 4. Testing

Added a comprehensive test script to verify all fixes:
- `/test-subscription-api.js`

The test script verifies:
1. Subscription types endpoint is working correctly
2. Subscription creation returns complete objects with IDs
3. Authorization header handling is working properly
4. Different request body formats are processed correctly

## How to Test

Run the following command to test the fixes:

```bash
AUTH_TOKEN=your_token USER_ID=your_user_id node test-subscription-api.js
```

Expected output should show all tests passing.

## Future Improvements

1. Further enhance error handling in the subscription service
2. Add more validation for edge cases in request formats
3. Improve logging for better debugging
4. Add automated integration tests that run as part of CI/CD
