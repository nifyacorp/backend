# Fixing Template Service & Subscription Types

## Issues Fixed

1. **Subscription Types Endpoint Returning 500 Error**
   - Added improved migration script to correctly create and populate the `subscription_types` table
   - Enhanced mock data in the database client for development mode
   - Fixed implementation of `createType` method in type.service.js

2. **Template Service Endpoints Failing with 500 Error**
   - Created robust migration script for the `subscription_templates` table
   - Added comprehensive mock data for template queries
   - Ensured template data includes all necessary fields (id, name, type, prompts, etc.)

## Implementation Details

### Migration System Improvement

Created a new migration file `20250406000000_fix_subscription_types.sql` that:
- Checks if tables exist before trying to create them
- Validates table structure and recreates tables if they're malformed
- Inserts default template and subscription type data
- Establishes proper indexes and RLS policies for security
- Registers the migration in the schema_version table

### Development Mode Enhancement

Modified the database client to improve development workflow when skip validation is enabled:
- Added comprehensive mock responses for all subscription type queries
- Implemented detailed mock template data to match expected fields
- Ensured mock data follows the same structure as production data
- Provided consistent mock responses for related queries (getSubscriptionTypeId, etc.)

### Schema Verification

The fix ensures that all required tables exist with proper structure:
- `subscription_types` with the columns: id, name, description, icon, is_system, etc.
- `subscription_templates` with: id, type, name, description, prompts, frequency, etc.

## Testing

To test these changes:
1. Run the backend with database validation skipped:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development SKIP_DB_VALIDATION=true npm run dev
   ```

2. The types endpoint should now return mock data:
   ```
   GET /api/v1/subscriptions/types
   ```

3. The templates endpoint should also work:
   ```
   GET /api/v1/templates
   ```

4. When deployed to production, the migration will properly create/update the required tables.

## Future Considerations

1. **Schema Monitoring**: Consider implementing a database schema monitoring system to detect inconsistencies
2. **Migration Testing**: Add tests for each migration to verify they apply correctly
3. **Development Data**: Create a more comprehensive development data setup script
