# Email Notification Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive email notification system for the NIFYA application, allowing users to receive daily digests of their notifications via email. The implementation follows best practices for cloud-native architecture, with separate microservices, message-based communication, and robust error handling.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Database Schema Extensions

- Added new columns to the `users` table:
  - `email_notifications` (boolean): Toggle for enabling/disabling email notifications
  - `notification_email` (string): Optional custom email for notifications
  - `digest_time` (time): User's preferred time to receive daily digest

- Added tracking fields to the `notifications` table:
  - `email_sent` (boolean): Flag indicating if the notification has been sent via email
  - `email_sent_at` (timestamp): When the notification was sent

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

- Created new endpoints for email notification management:
  - `GET /api/v1/users/me/email-preferences`: Get email notification preferences
  - `PATCH /api/v1/users/me/email-preferences`: Update email notification preferences
  - `POST /api/v1/users/me/test-email`: Send a test email
  - `POST /api/v1/users/notifications/mark-sent`: Mark notifications as sent via email

- Added validation schemas for these endpoints:
  - `emailPreferencesSchema`: Validates email preference updates
  - `testEmailSchema`: Validates test email requests
  - `markEmailSentSchema`: Validates notification marking requests

### 3. Frontend Components

- Created a new `EmailNotificationSettings` component with:
  - Toggle for enabling email notifications
  - Option to use custom email address
  - Time picker for daily digest time preference
  - "Send Test Email" button for verification

- Implemented `useEmailPreferences` hook to handle:
  - Fetching email preferences
  - Updating email preferences
  - Sending test emails

### 4. Email Notification Service Integration

- Enhanced the notification service to:
  - Check if user has email notifications enabled
  - Extract notification title for email
  - Publish to the appropriate PubSub topic

- Implemented PubSub client for:
  - Publishing messages to email notification topics
  - Supporting both immediate and daily digest notifications

### 5. Deployment Infrastructure

- Created a deployment script for:
  - Building and deploying the email notification service
  - Setting up PubSub topics and subscriptions
  - Creating Cloud Scheduler job for daily digests

### 6. Database Repository

- Implemented `UserEmailPreferencesRepository` for:
  - Managing user email preferences
  - Fetching unprocessed notifications for email
  - Marking notifications as sent

## Architecture

The email notification system follows a microservices architecture:

1. **Main Backend API**: Handles user preferences and queues notifications
2. **Email Notification Service**: Processes notifications and sends emails
3. **PubSub**: Connects these services for asynchronous processing
4. **Cloud Scheduler**: Triggers daily digest processing

This design provides several benefits:
- Separation of concerns
- Independent scaling
- Resilience to failures
- Asynchronous processing

## Implementation Details

### Database Migrations

Added a new migration file (`20250324000000_email_notification_preferences.sql`) to:
- Add the new columns to the database
- Create appropriate indexes for performance
- Add RLS policies for security

### API Controllers

Implemented the `email-preferences.controller.js` with methods to:
- Get user email preferences
- Update user email preferences
- Send test emails
- Mark notifications as sent

### Frontend React Components

Created React components using:
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- React hooks for state management
- Form validation for email addresses
- Time formatting for digest preferences

### Integration with Existing Code

Enhanced the notification service by:
- Adding PubSub client integration
- Checking user preferences before publishing
- Extracting notification title
- Handling connection errors gracefully

## Next Steps

While the implementation is comprehensive, there are several enhancements that could be made:

1. **Analytics**: Add tracking for email open rates and click-through rates
2. **Notification Categories**: Allow users to choose which types of notifications they receive
3. **Rich Email Templates**: Enhance email templates with more formatting and branding
4. **Frequency Options**: Add weekly digest option in addition to daily digests
5. **A/B Testing**: Test different email formats and sending times for optimal engagement

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test email preference validation
   - Test notification title extraction
   - Test PubSub message formatting

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test end-to-end flow from notification creation to email
   - Test preference updates
   - Test notification marking

3. **User Testing**:
   - Verify email delivery in different email clients
   - Check mobile responsiveness of emails
   - Test with users with different notification volumes
