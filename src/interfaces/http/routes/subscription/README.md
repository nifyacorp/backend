# Subscription Routes Refactoring

This directory contains the refactored subscription routes, split into logical modules for better maintainability and organization.

## Structure

- `index.js` - Main entry point that combines all subscription routes
- `types.routes.js` - Routes for subscription type operations
- `crud.routes.js` - Routes for basic CRUD operations on subscriptions
- `process.routes.js` - Routes for subscription processing
- `sharing.routes.js` - Routes for subscription sharing

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and maintain
2. **Better Organization**: Routes are grouped by functionality
3. **Clearer Responsibilities**: Each file has a specific purpose
4. **Easier Testing**: Smaller modules are easier to test
5. **Reduced Merge Conflicts**: Team members working on different features are less likely to conflict

## Implementation Notes

The refactoring preserves all existing functionality while improving the code organization. The main changes are:

1. Split the large `subscription.routes.js` file into smaller, focused modules
2. Created a new index file to combine all routes
3. Updated imports to reflect the new structure
4. Added better documentation and comments

## Usage

The refactored routes are used exactly the same way as before:

```javascript
import { subscriptionRoutes } from './interfaces/http/routes/subscription/index.js';

// Register routes
fastify.register(subscriptionRoutes, { prefix: '/api/v1/subscriptions' });
```

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for each route module
- Consider further splitting large route handlers into controller functions
- Add OpenAPI documentation for each endpoint
