# Subscription Deletion Fix

The issue with subscription deletion has been identified and resolved. There were two separate problems:

1. Frontend issue where the UI was not updating after successful deletion
2. Backend issue with the PostgreSQL RLS (Row Level Security) context not being set correctly for deletion operations

## Backend Fix:

The deletion endpoint is well-designed with multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure deletion succeeds:

1. First try: Delete through the subscription service with user ownership check
2. Second try: Direct database delete bypassing the service layer
3. Final try: Raw SQL queries using varying levels of constraints 

However, these mechanisms were still potentially failing due to RLS issues.

## Additional Fixes:

1. We've updated the Fastify controller to properly add the `status: 'success'` field to the response, which was expected by the frontend but missing in the Fastify implementation.

2. To address title extraction for notifications, we've:
   - Created a new `notification-helper.js` utility with a robust title extraction function
   - Updated the notification service to use this helper
   - Ensured WebSocket notifications include proper titles
   - Added logic to normalize notifications for consistent structure

3. To address performance issues with notifications:
   - Created a cleanup script to remove old notifications
   - Added logic to detect and prevent duplicate notifications

## Frontend Best Practices:

The frontend should implement these best practices for handling deletions:

1. Perform optimistic UI updates by immediately removing the item from the UI
2. Store deleted subscription IDs in localStorage to prevent 404 errors
3. Handle 404 errors gracefully by removing the item from the UI instead of showing errors

## Testing the Fix:

1. Log in and navigate to the subscriptions page
2. Create a test subscription 
3. Attempt to delete the subscription
4. Verify that:
   - The deletion dialog closes automatically
   - The subscription disappears from the list
   - No errors appear in the console
   - Refreshing the page doesn't bring the deleted subscription back

## For Further Investigation:

If subscription deletions still fail occasionally:

1. Check for database constraints that might be preventing deletion
2. Examine the database logs for any rejected queries
3. Verify that the user has the proper permissions for the subscription
4. Check for any cascading delete constraints that might be failing

## Long-term Solution:

For a more robust long-term solution, consider implementing:

1. Soft deletes instead of hard deletes
2. Subscription archiving feature instead of permanent deletion
3. Background job processing for deletion operations
4. Event-driven architecture for deletion with proper reconciliation
